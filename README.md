## > What is it?

A poor mans IaaS as a Service (IaaSaaS, some may call it a hypervisor). You can use it to deploy containers like VPSs (and get people to pay you for it).

It has EDoS and DDoS detection (iptables blacklists IPs which are abusive).

## > Installation

This is still in heavy development. It will probably not be working.

If you want to do stuff, just clone this repo and run `make` to build and bring up the basic infrastructure. There may or may not be setup interface on 0.0.0.0:80.
